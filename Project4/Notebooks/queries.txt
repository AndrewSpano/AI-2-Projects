Question: How is the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis made in TB clinics and hospitals?

Passage: Diagnosis of pulmonary TB in hospitals and TB clinics is made on the basis of clinical
          examination; chest radiography and sputum smear microscopy and/or sputum culture.
          Following diagnosis, patients enter the DOTS program which prescribes short-course
          chemotherapy (SCC) comprising 2 months of isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), pyrazinamide (Z)
          plus streptomycin (S) or ethambutol (E) followed by 4 months of H and R. (line 248)

Question: How was the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis for MHV confirmed?

Passage: The importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endosome maturation for MHV fusion was
            confirmed by analysis of endocytosis-affecting agents using the fusion assay. After
            preloading with FDG, cells were pre-treated with the inhibitors for 30 min at 37uC,
            after which cells were inoculated with MHV-aN in the presence of the agents, and
            analyzed by FACS as described above. (line 884)
          OR
         Endocytosis-affecting agents indicate clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endosome maturation
          to be important in MHV infection. (line 768)

Question: Which alternatives do we have for conventional chemotherapy?

Passage: Highly effective and attenuated dose schedules are good regimens for drug research and
          development. Combination chemotherapy is a good strategy in cancer therapy. (line 115)
         OR
         Different chemotherapy strategies were carried out in different endemic areas: mass
          chemotherapy was used for the people from endemic areas with a high prevalence and with a
          history of water contact. (line 201)

Question: Is there a drug to treat the EV71 infection?

Passage: Milrinone therapy may provide a useful therapeutic approach for treating life-threatening
         EV71 infections. (line 629)
          OR
         There is no effective drug to treat EV71 infection yet. (line 230)

Question: Which scanning technique was used to confirm hypotheses regarding the MAb-1G10 epitope
            structure?

Passage: Confirmation of critical MAb-1G10 residues by alanine scanning. An alanine scanning
          technique was used to determine if either of these hypotheses regarding the MAb-1G10
          epitope structure might be correct. (line 478)
